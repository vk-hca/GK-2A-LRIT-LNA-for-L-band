<p><b><font size="6">Comparison to a minimal set up</font></b></p>
<p><font size="4">Here is an example of a quick minimal setup that works with just a 
cheap inline catv amp and power injector, its enough to get you started with out any construction 
work, obviously not a permanent installation.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Open the end of some 75 ohm coax and from a dipole about 88 mm 
across, centre conductor on one side, screen on the other. leave a couple of mm 
insulation on the centre to ensure 100% there is no short circuit because the 
amp passes the power input, and mount it 
in the focal point of the dish. This dish is 2.1 mt.</font></p>

<p>With a power injector feeding between 12 to 18 vdc for the inline amp and 
RTL_SDR and SDR# you should see the signal. Results will vary with location in 
the footprint.</p>

<p>This is just enough to decode the image.</p>
<p>The modified S band LNB in the same dish powered via the same power injector 
feeding the SDR should produce a result like this.</p>
