Comparison to a minimal set up
==============================

Here is an example of a quick minimal setup that works with just a cheap inline catv amp and power injector, its enough to get you started with out any construction work, obviously not a permanent installation.

Open the end of some 75 ohm coax and from a dipole about 88 mm across, centre conductor on one side, screen on the other. leave a couple of mm insulation on the centre to ensure 100% there is no short circuit because the amp passes the power input, and mount it in the focal point of the dish. This dish is 2.1 mt.

With a power injector feeding between 12 to 18 vdc for the inline amp and RTL_SDR and SDR# you should see the signal. Results will vary with location in the footprint.

This is just enough to decode the image.

The modified S band LNB in the same dish powered via the same power injector feeding the SDR should produce a result like this.
