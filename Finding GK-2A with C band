If your system appears not to work you can verify the dish alignment another way.
A couple of hints, with respect to a prime focus dish. 1.8mt
Setting the skew for your location seems more important than having the dish not quite peaked up.

From within the foot print of Laosat1 at 128.5E, if you find it, the dish is pointing near enough at GK-2A. 
From within the footprint of Telstar 18 Vantage at 138E if you find it, put the feed on the lower (eastern) side of the C band scalar and you should find GK-2A.

Satellite beacons can also be used in no DVB-S2 reciever is to hand, subtract from 5150 to use a Cband LNB outout with SDR eg Laosat 1 5150.00 -	3695.00 = 1455.00

Laosat 1  	3695.00 H / 3699.00 V / 3717.00 H 
Telstar 18 3623.00 L or V / 3625.00 L or V / 4199.00 L or H
